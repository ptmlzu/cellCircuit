#Cell circuits

##Background

Recently there were some interesting success in the field of biologically [powered circuits](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151207/ncomms10070/pdf/ncomms10070.pdf).

The team from Columbia University managed to power the CMOS circuit with the biological power
of ATP. This should be mentioned that currently only macro model was developed.
This could be estimated as the breaking through in creation of the interface from
the electronic to bio world on the cellular level.

##Our idea

The idea is to minimize the proposed devices to  fit in a eukaryotic cell, to put
electronic circuits inside cells. This electronics could do some extra work that was not originally
done by the biological cell.

For example: we could think of:
- processing some simple computations in a cell
- creating computational cellular network in the living tissue
- creating RLC circuits in a cell for wireless communications in the neuronal axons, that usually have enough
length to place an antenna

Overall this could be visioned as a new direction: in pharmacy as electronic drugs,
brain - computer interface, brain - brain interface, in general: almost any living tissue
to any living tissue electronic interfaces.

##Cross-disciplinarity

This approach is heavily cross-disciplinary, we could introduce several domains:

1. **Chemistry** for the bio-electronics interface
1. **Electronics** for the circuitry and proper technology
1. **Cytology** for the integration of the cellular circuits into a living cell
1. **Neuroscience** for the integration of the cellular circuits into the neurons

##Problems

There could be identified several problems even on the stage of preliminary analysis:

1. The energy consumption of the electronic schema could be too exhausting for the living cell, this could be possibly mitigated in neurons via help of astrocytes that could provide increased glucose from the blood stream.
1. There could be a problem in placement of the antenna in an axon.
1. There could be problem in minimization of the bio-electrical adapter to nano-sizes. 


##Practical use

We could identify several domains that could make use of this novel approach:

1. **Electronic pharmacy**: the drugs could be electronic circuits that could be delivered to cells and do some smart curing processes: count number of centrioles in a cell if the number exceeds normal level (this is the characteristic of cancer cell), destroy it.
1. **Computing living tissue** this technology could do some information processing for example inside someones skin. We could think of computing plants, even bacteria colonies.
1. **Natural neural network or brain to computer interface** the cellular circuits could be connected in some complex device with option to communicate wireless that could be used as gateway to the brain providing the option to brain -- brain interface, brain -- cloud interface or even used to communicate with external robotic devices like prosthesis exoskeletons etc. This gateway device could be naturally grown in the brain.

Implantable(s)
I have discussed the proposal (and the referenced paper) with a colleague who is an expert in sensor technologies and app development - his comment may be summarised as follows:

From what I’ve read there’s been a lot of interest in the last few years related to how best to interface electronics to bodily systems. Apparently it’s (as you’d expect) quite difficult given the nervous system is electrochemical and silicon chips are electrical. So on that basis power harvesting from bodily systems should also be important. And I can see why you’d take an interest in it as implantable(s) would solve a lot of data gathering issues related to human context.
 
I remember from years ago that ATP is the main source of accessible energy in human cells so it seems a very interesting piece of research. The power output is very low though, so I’m not sure how useful it would be for sending data wirelessly out of the body unless an antenna was very near the skin. However, I seem to remember reading about researchers looking at implantable electronics to correct for physiological problems (maybe, e.g. hand trembling, or to bypass damaged nerves in paralysis or blindness), so the low power potential may not be such an issue for that.

I think the proposed list of interested companies may be increased to include companies who develop and manufacture sensors?
